  <p>I am an undergraduate student in the School of <a href="https://aix.ssu.ac.kr/">AI Convergence</a> at Soongsil University and an undergraduate researcher in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ssu-nlp/home">Natural Language Processing Lab</a>. My research interests lie in improving the factual reliability and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, I am interested in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as an approach to enhancing factual grounding, while also investigating how reasoning abilities can be improved through more structured and efficient modeling strategies.</p>
